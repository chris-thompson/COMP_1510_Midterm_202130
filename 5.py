"""
The Lo Shu Magic Square is a matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns.

The Lo Shu Magic Square has the following two properties:
i.  The grid contains the numbers 1 through 9 (each number appears once)
ii. The sum of each row, column, and each diagonal is the same number.

In this example, the sum is 15:
4   9   2
3   5   7
8   1   6

We can simulate a magic square using a 2D list in Python.
Define a function called validate_lo_shu that accepts a 2D list as an argument.
The function must return True if the list is a Lo Shu Magic Square.
The function must return Return False if it is anything else.

You may not modify the 2D list passed as an argument in any way, even temporarily.
You must create two useful doctests for this function.
No main function is required.
