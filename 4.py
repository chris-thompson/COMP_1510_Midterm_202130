Suppose there are three seating categories in a venue.

Class A seats cost $200.
Class B seats cost $150.
Class C seats cost $100.

Write a program that asks the user how many seats for each class were sold,
and then displays the total amount of income generated from ticket sales.

Ensure you format the sum as currency.

Remember. I'm asking you for a program, not a single function.

IMPORTANT: Ensure nothing is executed when I import this module.
