"""
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get:

3, 5, 6 and 9

The sum of these multiples is 23.

Define a function called pointless_flex that accepts a single parameter, a positive
non-zero integer called upper_bound. The function calculates and returns the sum of all
the multiples of 3 or 5 strictly below upper_bound, i.e., in the range (0, upper_bound).

You must provide a full docstring for this function including all pre- and post-conditions.

You must create two useful doctests for this function.
No main function is required.
